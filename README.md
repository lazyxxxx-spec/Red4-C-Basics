# 🧠 C Basics — From Zero to Hero

A comprehensive collection of beginner-friendly C programs designed to take you from absolute beginner to confident coder. Each program builds upon the previous one, introducing new concepts in a structured and practical way.

## 📚 Programs Overview

### **1. hello.c** - Hello World Program
**Description**: The classic introductory program that every programmer starts with. This simple program demonstrates the basic structure of a C program and how to output text to the console.

**Key Concepts**:
- `#include` preprocessor directive
- `main()` function as program entry point
- `printf()` function for output
- Basic program structure and syntax

### **2. CV.c** - User Input Program
**Description**: Introduces user interaction by capturing and displaying user input. This program teaches how to work with variables and read data from the user.

**Key Concepts**:
- Variables and data types (`char` arrays)
- `scanf()` function for input
- String manipulation
- Basic I/O operations

### **3. sum.c** - Basic Arithmetic Operation
**Description**: A simple addition program that introduces arithmetic operations and working with numerical data types.

**Key Concepts**:
- Integer data types (`int`)
- Arithmetic operations
- Multiple variable input
- Basic calculation and output

### **4. calcul.c** - Advanced Calculator
**Description**: A fully-featured calculator that handles multiple arithmetic operations with error checking. Demonstrates control structures and input validation.

**Key Concepts**:
- `switch` statements for multiple conditions
- Floating-point numbers (`double`)
- Error handling (division by zero)
- Operator validation
- Complex program logic

### **5. madlibs.c** - Interactive Story Game
**Description**: A fun Mad Libs-style game that demonstrates string handling and creative programming. Shows how to work with multiple strings and create interactive stories.

**Key Concepts**:
- String input with `fgets()`
- String manipulation with `strtok()`
- Multiple variable handling
- Creative output formatting
- Interactive storytelling

## 🛠️ Compilation and Execution

### **Prerequisites**
- GCC compiler installed on your system
- Basic command-line knowledge

### **Compilation Commands**
```bash
# Compile individual programs
gcc -o hello hello.c
gcc -o cv CV.c
gcc -o sum sum.c
gcc -o calculator calcul.c
gcc -o madlibs madlibs.c

# Run the programs
./hello
./cv
./sum
./calculator
./madlibs
```

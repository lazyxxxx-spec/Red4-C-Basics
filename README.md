🧠 C Basics — From Zero to Hero

Welcome to C Basics: From Zero to Hero, a repository that contains simple and essential C programs designed to help beginners understand the foundations of C programming.
Each file introduces a new concept and builds your confidence step by step.

📂 Project Structure

This repo currently includes the following beginner-friendly programs:

1. hello.c — Hello World

A simple program that prints "Hello, World!" to the terminal.
Shows how to:

include standard libraries (stdio.h)

use printf

compile and run a basic C file

2. CV.c — User Input

A program that asks the user for their name and then displays it on the terminal.
Concepts used:

reading strings using scanf

storing input in variables

printing user input back to the screen

3. calcul.c — Basic Calculator

A simple calculator that:

asks the user for first number

asks for the operator (+, -, *, /)

asks for the second number

performs the calculation using a switch statement

Additional rule:

You cannot divide by 0, so the program checks using an if / else condition and prevents invalid operations.

4. madlibs.c — Mini Mad Libs Game

A small storytelling game where the user enters:

a noun

a verb ending in “-ing”

adjective 1

adjective 2

The program then prints a fun story using the user’s inputs.

▶️ How to Compile and Run

Make sure you have a C compiler such as gcc installed.
